    "# Text Classification, Spam Detection, Topic Modeling, and Document Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Text classification is the process of assigning predefined categories or labels to a text. This can involve categorizing news articles, emails, or any other text data into different classes based on their content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Classifying customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review:** \"The product quality is amazing and I love it!\"  \n",
    "**Classified as:** Positive\n",
    "\n",
    "### Email Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Classifying emails as work-related, personal, promotional, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Email:** \"Meeting at 3 PM tomorrow to discuss the project status.\"  \n",
    "**Classified as:** Work-related\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spam Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Spam detection is a specific type of text classification where the goal is to identify and filter out unwanted or irrelevant emails or messages, often referred to as spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Email Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Classifying emails as spam or not spam (ham).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Email:** \"Congratulations! You've won a $1000 gift card. Click here to claim.\"  \n",
    "**Classified as:** Spam\n",
    "\n",
    "**Email:** \"Hi, can we reschedule our meeting to 3 PM?\"  \n",
    "**Classified as:** Not Spam\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is an unsupervised learning technique used to identify the underlying topics present in a collection of documents. It helps in discovering the abstract themes or topics that occur in a set of texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyzing Research Papers\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying topics in a collection of research papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Papers:** Collection of papers on AI, data science, and machine learning.  \n",
    "**Topics:** AI Ethics, Deep Learning Techniques, Natural Language Processing, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):** A common algorithm used for topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Document 1:** \"Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results in image classification.\"  \n",
    "**Document 2:** \"Natural language processing techniques are improving rapidly with new transformer models.\"  \n",
    "**Identified Topics:** \"Deep Learning\" and \"Natural Language Processing\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Document Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Document classification is similar to text classification but often involves longer texts such as articles, reports, or legal documents. It aims to categorize entire documents into predefined classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### News Article Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorizing news articles into topics like sports, politics, technology, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Article:** \"The new AI model developed by researchers shows promising results in various benchmarks.\"  \n",
    "**Classified as:** Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Legal Document Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Classifying legal documents as contracts, agreements, patents, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Document:** \"This agreement is made between the two parties and outlines the terms and conditions of the partnership.\"  \n",
    "**Classified as:** Agreement\n"
